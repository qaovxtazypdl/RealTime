<Legacy: RedBoot + TS7200>

To compile type simply type make, main.elf will be generated in the root directory
To run copy main.elf to the tftp server and run

load -h 10.15.167.5 <tftp elf location>;go

For convenience the following pre-built binary has been created.

load -h 10.15.167.5 "ARM/rvaiya/a4.elf";go
